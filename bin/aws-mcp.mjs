/**
 * Runtime launcher for @yawlabs/aws-mcp.
 *
 * Prefers the newest usable oam runtime (https://oamjs.org) and falls back to
 * Node. It never serves on an oam older than the floor below.
 *
 *
 * WHY THE FALLBACK COSTS NOTHING
 * npm has already started Node to run this launcher, so falling back is a
 * plain `import()` of the server into THIS process: no extra spawn, no extra
 * startup, byte-identical to invoking dist/index.js directly. Finding the
 * candidates is stat-only, so a machine without oam never pays for a
 * subprocess.
 *
 * WHAT THE OAM PATH COSTS
 * Reaching oam through an npm `bin` means Node boots first, every oam binary
 * found is asked for its version, and then oam boots to serve -- so the
 * launcher is slower than pointing a host at oam directly. Measured on
 * npmjs-mcp (windows-arm64, n=12 medians, spawn to first MCP initialize):
 * oam 116ms, node 172ms, launcher 243ms. It exists for `npx` convenience.
 *
 * For an MCP host config, point straight at oam and skip this file:
 *   { "command": "oam", "args": ["run", "<abs>/dist/index.js"] }
 *
 * WHICH OAM
 * OAM_BIN, when set and usable, is used as given. Otherwise every oam binary
 * discovery can see -- the installed locations, then PATH -- is asked for its
 * version, and the NEWEST one at or above the floor wins; a tie keeps search
 * order. Taking the first binary found instead let a stale copy early in the
 * search order hide a current one later: with oam 0.9.0 installed in ~/.oam/bin
 * and 0.15.2 on PATH, the launcher bound to 0.9.0 because installed locations
 * are searched first.
 *
 * An OAM_BIN that does not exist, is below the floor, or will not run is named
 * on stderr and discovery carries on. It used to stop everything silently: a
 * typo in OAM_BIN meant Node, with no hint why.
 *
 * ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM
 * A host can resolve this package's `bin` and launch `oam run <this file>`
 * instead of `node <this file>` -- Yaw MCP does, and so does oam's sidecar
 * regression matrix. When `process.versions.oam` clears the floor, the server
 * is imported into THIS process exactly as the Node fallback is -- no
 * discovery, no `oam --version` probe, no second oam.
 *
 * A host oam BELOW the floor never serves. It used to, whenever discovery came
 * up empty. It now hands the server off to the newest usable oam, or to Node
 * found on PATH, or exits with an error when there is neither.
 *
 * That handoff PIPES stdio rather than inheriting it. Before 0.9.0 oam treated
 * `stdio: 'inherit'` as `'pipe'`, so an inherited handoff from such a host
 * connected the child to pipes nobody reads: measured with a real oam 0.8.2
 * host, the MCP handshake never answered. Piping the streams explicitly
 * completes it, to both oam and Node. A Node host keeps `inherit`, which hands
 * over the same fds untouched.
 *
 * NO SANDBOX HERE -- DELIBERATELY
 * oam's `--permission` is genuinely useful, but not for this server. Its
 * endpoints are not a fixed set: SSO device authorization resolves to
 * `device.sso.<region>.amazonaws.com` and the portal to `<org>.awsapps.com`,
 * both chosen at run time from the caller's profile, and every regional service
 * endpoint is reachable through `aws_call`. Covering that means `--allow-net`
 * bare. It also shells out to the `aws` CLI on essentially every tool, so
 * `--allow-child-process` is mandatory, and the CLI needs the filesystem for
 * ~/.aws/config and the SSO cache. The sandbox would end up granting everything
 * it gates, so it is not offered rather than shipped as security theatre.
 *
 * MINIMUM OAM VERSION
 * The floor, bumped to each new oam release. Currently 0.16.3, verified on it:
 * full MCP handshake, all 28 tools (2026-09-20, oam 0.16.3 aarch64-pc-windows-msvc,
 * checksum matched against the release SHA256SUMS). It is a FLOOR, not a pin: the
 * launcher runs the newest oam it finds at or above it, and falls back to Node
 * rather than serving on an older one -- which is the point, because an older oam
 * is not what this server is verified on.
 * Only the current oam is used and verified; an older one falls back to Node.
 * The floor is not cosmetic: before 0.9.0 `child_process.execFile` ran its
 * arguments through a SHELL, `exec` accepted `timeout` and ignored it,
 * `spawnSync` truncated at `maxBuffer` while reporting success, and
 * `stdio: 'inherit'`/`'ignore'` both behaved as `'pipe'`. This server shells
 * out to a CLI on its main paths, so those were reachable bugs rather than
 * theoretical ones: an argument containing shell metacharacters was re-split
 * and executed.
 *
 * SELECTION
 *   AWS_MCP_RUNTIME=auto   newest usable oam, else Node (default)
 *   AWS_MCP_RUNTIME=oam    newest usable oam, else exit with an error
 *                          (already running on oam at the floor satisfies it)
 *   AWS_MCP_RUNTIME=node   Node: in THIS process on Node, handed off to Node
 *                          on PATH when THIS process is oam
 *   OAM_BIN=/path/to/oam   use this oam when it is usable, before discovery
 * The value is case-insensitive; anything else behaves like `auto`.
